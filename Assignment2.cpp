//you are developing a dictionary application. Design a function that takes in a word and returns 
//its definition. Implement this function using binary search on a sorted list of words.
//• Implement a WordDefinition class that represents a word and its definition. The class should 
//have private member variables for the word and its definition.
//• Include public member functions search for word and get its definition.
//Suppose the dictionary contains the following entries:
//apple - A fruit that grows on trees.
//banana - A long curved fruit that grows in clusters.
//orange - A citrus fruit with a tough orange skin and segments inside.
//pineapple - A tropical fruit with a rough, spiky skin and sweet flesh.
//If the user inputs the word "apple", the application should output:
//A fruit that grows on trees.
